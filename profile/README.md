aelf is a high-performance, cloud-native, layer-1 blockchain network with its Mainnet nodes running on different cloud-computing data centers. It provides a high-speed running environment for smart contracts and enables the execution of contracts in parallel and smart contract microservitization running on server clusters. Its MainChain and multi-SideChains architecture supports efficient indexing within the network and guarantees almost unlimited scalability. The built-in cross-chain design facilitates ultra-fast interaction of data.
